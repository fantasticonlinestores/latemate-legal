## 1. Information We Collect

### 1.1 Account Data

When you create a LateMate account, we collect:

- **Email address** -- used for authentication and account recovery
- **Display name** -- a user-chosen name (3-20 alphanumeric characters) shown to your pair partner
- **Avatar selection** -- a choice from our predefined avatar set (we do not accept image uploads)

- **Pair settings** -- your customized unit labels (e.g., "coffees") and minutes-per-unit configuration

### 1.3 Derived Data

We calculate the following from your usage data:

- **Units owed** -- calculated from wait session durations using your pair-specific rules (e.g., minutes per unit)

## 4. How We Store and Protect Your Data

### 4.1 Storage

Your data is stored on servers operated by Supabase (our backend provider), which uses PostgreSQL databases with row-level security (RLS) policies ensuring users can only access their own data and their pair's shared data.

### 4.2 Security Measures

We implement the following security measures:

- **Encryption in transit** -- all data transmitted between the App and our servers uses TLS/HTTPS
- **Encryption at rest** -- database storage is encrypted at rest
- **Password hashing** -- passwords are hashed using industry-standard algorithms and are never stored in plain text
- **Row-level security** -- database policies restrict data access to authorized users only
- **Secure token storage** -- authentication tokens are stored using platform-secure storage (Keychain on iOS, encrypted storage on Android)
- **Minimal data collection** -- we only collect data necessary for App functionality

### 4.3 Breach Notification

We have data breach notification procedures in place to comply with applicable laws:

- **GDPR (EU/UK):** In the event of a personal data breach likely to result in a risk to your rights and freedoms, we will notify the relevant supervisory authority within **72 hours** of becoming aware of the breach. If the breach is likely to result in a **high risk** to you, we will also notify you directly without undue delay via email and/or in-app notification.

- **Australian Notifiable Data Breaches (NDB) Scheme:** If we experience a data breach that is likely to result in **serious harm** to any individual, we will conduct a reasonable and expeditious assessment within **30 days** of becoming aware of the breach (or suspected breach). If the breach is an "eligible data breach," we will notify the **Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC)** and affected individuals as soon as practicable. Notification will include the nature of the breach, the kinds of information involved, and recommended steps you can take.

- **US State Laws:** We will comply with applicable US state breach notification requirements.

We process your personal data under the legal bases described in Section 2. In summary:

- **Performance of a contract (Art. 6(1)(b))** -- processing necessary to provide the App and its features to you, including account management, session tracking, pair management, units owed calculations, and subscription processing
- **Consent (Art. 6(1)(a))** -- for push notifications; you can withdraw consent at any time and it is as easy to withdraw as it is to give
- **Legitimate interests (Art. 6(1)(f))** -- for crash reporting via Sentry (our interest: ensuring app stability by identifying and fixing crashes) and for App improvement using aggregated, anonymized data (our interest: improving functionality and performance). We have assessed that these interests do not override your rights and freedoms

- **Withdraw consent** -- at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. Withdrawing consent is as easy as giving it

### 9.3 Data Protection Officer

For GDPR-related inquiries, contact us at latemateapp@gmail.com with "GDPR Request" in the subject line.

### 9.4 Data Transfers

### 10.2 How We Use Personal Information

We use personal information for the business purposes described in Section 2 of this Privacy Policy. We use sensitive personal information (account login credentials) **only** for the purpose of authenticating your account and providing the service -- we do not use it for any secondary purpose beyond what is necessary to provide the App.

### 10.3 Sale and Sharing of Personal Information

- **We do not sell your personal information.** We have not sold personal information in the preceding 12 months.
- **We do not share your personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising.**

- **Know** -- request disclosure of the categories and specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you
- **Delete** -- request deletion of your personal information
- **Correct** -- request correction of inaccurate personal information
- **Opt out of sale/sharing** -- we do not sell or share your data, so no opt-out is necessary
- **Non-discrimination** -- we will not discriminate against you for exercising your privacy rights
- **Limit use of sensitive personal information** -- we only use sensitive personal information (account login credentials) for authentication purposes, which is necessary to provide the service. No additional limitation is needed
- **Data portability** -- request your data in a readily useable, portable format (JSON or CSV)

### 10.5 How to Exercise Your Rights

You may submit a verifiable consumer request by contacting us at latemateapp@gmail.com. We will verify your identity before fulfilling any request. You may also authorize an agent to submit a request on your behalf.

- **Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (VCDPA)**
- **Colorado Privacy Act (CPA)**
- **Connecticut Data Privacy Act (CTDPA)**
- **Oregon Consumer Privacy Act (OCPA)**
- **Delaware Personal Data Privacy Act (DPDPA)**

- **Correct** inaccurate personal data

## 12. Your Privacy Rights Under CalOPPA

In accordance with the California Online Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA), effective since January 1, 2014, we make the following disclosures:

### 12.1 Conspicuous Posting

This Privacy Policy is accessible from the App settings and on our website at https://fantasticonlinestores.github.io/latemate-legal.

### 12.2 Information About Data Collected

We describe the categories of personal information we collect in Section 1 and how that information is used in Section 2 of this policy.

### 12.3 Third Parties

We describe third parties with whom we share information in Sections 5 and 6 of this policy.

### 12.4 Do Not Track Signals

LateMate does not track users across third-party websites. We do not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals because our App does not track users for advertising purposes. No third-party tracking occurs within the App.

We will notify users of material changes to this Privacy Policy by updating the "Last Updated" date and, where appropriate, through an in-app notification. See Section 20 for details.

## 13. Your Privacy Rights Under Australian Privacy Law

As an Australian company, Fantastic Online Stores Pty Ltd complies with the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) and the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs).

### 13.1 Anonymity and Pseudonymity (APP 2)

LateMate requires account identification because the service involves pairing with another specific user to track shared wait sessions. Anonymous usage is not practicable for the core functionality of the App. However, you may choose any display name you wish -- it does not need to be your real name.

### 13.2 Access and Correction (APPs 12 & 13)

You have the right to:

- **Access** the personal information we hold about you
- **Request correction** of any information that is inaccurate, out-of-date, incomplete, irrelevant, or misleading

We will respond to access and correction requests within **30 calendar days**. If we refuse a request, we will provide written reasons and information about how to complain.

To make a request, contact us at latemateapp@gmail.com.

### 13.3 Complaints (APP 1)

If you believe we have breached the Australian Privacy Principles, you may:

1. **Contact us first** at latemateapp@gmail.com with "Privacy Complaint" in the subject line. We will acknowledge your complaint within 7 days and aim to resolve it within 30 days.
2. **Escalate to the OAIC** if you are not satisfied with our response. You can lodge a complaint with the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC):
   - Website: [oaic.gov.au](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/privacy-complaints)
   - Phone: 1300 363 992
   - Post: GPO Box 5218, Sydney NSW 2001

### 13.4 Cross-Border Disclosure (APP 8)

We disclose personal information to overseas recipients in the **United States** (see Section 5 for specific providers). We take reasonable steps to ensure these recipients comply with the Australian Privacy Principles, including maintaining Data Processing Agreements. We remain accountable for any breach by these overseas recipients.

### 13.5 Direct Marketing (APP 7)

We may use push notifications to inform you about new features or premium offerings. Under Australian law, this constitutes direct marketing. You can opt out of promotional notifications at any time by:

- Disabling push notifications in your device settings
- Adjusting notification preferences in the App settings

We will not send you promotional notifications unless you have opted in. Session-related notifications (e.g., "Your partner started waiting") are service notifications, not marketing.

---

## 14. Push Notifications and Direct Marketing

### 14.1 Push Notifications

- Push notifications are **opt-in** -- you choose whether to enable them
- We use push notifications for:
  - **Service notifications**: session alerts, pair updates, and wait reminders
  - **Promotional notifications**: new features, premium offerings (with your consent)
- You can disable notifications at any time through your device settings or the App
- Push notification tokens are stored securely and deleted when you disable notifications or delete your account
- Notification content may be processed by Expo's push notification service

### 14.2 Direct Marketing

Any promotional push notifications about premium features or weekly recaps constitute direct marketing. We will:

- Only send promotional notifications with your **opt-in consent**
- Provide a simple way to **opt out** at any time
- Clearly distinguish promotional notifications from service notifications
- Comply with the Australian Spam Act 2003 and applicable anti-spam laws

---

## 15. Cookies and Tracking Technologies

**LateMate does not use cookies.** The App does not use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags, or similar tracking technologies.

We do not engage in cross-app or cross-site tracking. We do not use advertising identifiers or participate in ad networks.

The only local storage we use is:

- **Secure token storage** -- to keep you signed in between sessions (stored in Keychain on iOS, encrypted storage on Android)
- **Local SQLite database** -- to enable offline functionality (see Section 16)

This local storage is **strictly necessary** for the App to function and does not require separate consent.

---

## 16. Offline Mode and Data Sync

LateMate supports offline usage. When you use the App without an internet connection:

- Session data is stored locally on your device in an encrypted SQLite database
- When connectivity is restored, locally stored data is synchronized with our servers
- Offline data is temporary and is removed from local storage after successful sync
- Local data is protected by your device's built-in security (passcode, biometrics)

---

## 17. Automated Decision-Making and Profiling

### 17.1 Automated Calculations

LateMate automatically calculates "units owed" based on your wait session durations and pair-specific rules (e.g., minutes per unit). The App also generates statistics such as total wait time, net difference between pair members, and session counts.

### 17.2 No Significant Automated Decisions

These calculations are straightforward arithmetic performed for entertainment purposes. **We do not engage in automated decision-making that produces legal or similarly significant effects on you** as described in GDPR Article 22. Specifically:

- No decisions about your access to the service are made automatically
- No pricing, credit, or eligibility decisions are made based on profiling
- The "units owed" and statistics are playful metrics with no legal, financial, or contractual significance
- No user data is used to create behavioral profiles for advertising or other purposes unrelated to the App's core functionality
